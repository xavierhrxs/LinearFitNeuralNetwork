# LinearFitNeuralNetwork
Neural Network for Linear Regression

Detailed Description:
This repository contains an implementation of a neural network designed for linear regression tasks. The network is trained to learn the optimal representation of data that approximates a linear relationship. The goal is to create a model capable of making accurate predictions on datasets exhibiting linear behavior. The code includes the definition of the neural network architecture, training and evaluation datasets, as well as examples for visualizing the results. This project serves as a practical introduction to using neural networks for simple curve fitting tasks.
